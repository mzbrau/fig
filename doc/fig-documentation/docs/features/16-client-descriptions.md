# Client Descriptions

When configuring many different clients, having a description of that application and what it does can be useful to the person performing the configuration. Fig forces developers to enter a value in for the client description when they start using Fig and this description is then available when performing the configuration.

The description can be written in markdown format and can be pulled from a markdown file which is an embedded resource in the project. See [Setting Descriptions](http://www.figsettings.com/docs/features/settings-management/setting-descriptions) for more details.

Note that fig supports combining multiple markdown files into a single client description. Each file can be specified separated by a comma.
