# Lookup Table Integrations

In addition to being able to create, update and delete lookup tables via the Fig web application, it is also possible to write an integration that performs the same functions. 

See the [SQL Lookup Table Service](https://github.com/mzbrau/fig/tree/main/src/integrations/Fig.Integration.SqlLookupTableService) for an example of how that works.
