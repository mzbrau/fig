As part of that framework it is possible to draw configuration from a variety of sources including appSettings.json files, environment variables and app.config files. App.config files are largely legacy but are sometimes required for backwards compatibility. They can be tricky to write so they are compatible with the nested structure of the appSettings.json files.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/authentication":{"id":"features/authentication","title":"Authentication","description":"Fig has built in authentication to protect your settings. Access to the Fig web application is protected by a username and password.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/azure-keyvault-integration":{"id":"features/azure-keyvault-integration","title":"Azure Key Vault Integration","description":"Fig can handle secret values with all setting values being stored encrypted in an enterprise database. However for some high security deployments it may be desirable to store secret values in a dedicated secret store such as Azure Key Vault. Fig has an integration to Azure Key Vault and if enabled, all values marked as secret attribute will be stored there rather than the fig database.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/change-message":{"id":"features/change-message","title":"Change Message","description":"When you save settings changes, you will be prompted to enter a change message. This message will be stored in the event log along with the value changes. It can be a good way to record the motivation behind the change.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/client-descriptions":{"id":"features/client-descriptions","title":"Client Descriptions","description":"When configuring many different clients, having a description of that application and what it does can be useful to the person performing the configuration. Fig forces developers to enter a value in for the client description when they start using Fig and this description is then available when performing the configuration.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/client-management":{"id":"features/client-management","title":"Client Management","description":"Administrators in Fig are able to see a list of all currently connected clients. Clients are considered connected if they poll the API at least once every 2 times the configured poll interval for that client. Clients will poll automatically as part of the Fig.Client nuget package and default to 30 seconds per poll.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/client-settings-override":{"id":"features/client-settings-override","title":"Client Settings Overrides","description":"In some situations you want the settings to be driven by the client. For example when deploying applications using Docker compose if you have address to other containers within the compose file, you can reference them by their container name. In that case, you would like the setting to be set by the docker compose file rather than having to be manually set in Fig or use a default.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/compact-view":{"id":"features/compact-view","title":"Compact View","description":"When there are lots of settings for a client or settings have large descriptions it can be difficult to get an overview of the settings and their values. This is where compact view can be useful. An individual setting can have their compact view toggled by clicking on the name. All settings under a client can be collapsed or expanded using the command buttons at the top of the settings.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/configuration":{"id":"features/configuration","title":"Configuration","description":"There are a few parameters which can be configured for Fig which enable or disable certain features in the application.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/environment-variables":{"id":"features/environment-variables","title":"Environment Variables","description":"Fig reads a number of environment variables.

An instance is a special key that can be passed by the calling client. When an instance is provided, Fig attempts to find settings matching that instance name. If none are found, the default settings for that client are returned.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/keyboard-shortcuts":{"id":"features/keyboard-shortcuts","title":"Keyboard Shortcuts","description":"The fig web application supports keyboard shortcuts for common operations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/live-reload":{"id":"features/live-reload","title":"Live Reload","description":"By default, clients using the Fig.Client nuget package will support the live reload of settings. This means that when a setting value is updated in the Web Client, that updated value will immediately be available in the settings class for that client. In addition, a settings changed event will be raised on the settings class which can be used to take action when it occurs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/lookup-tables":{"id":"features/lookup-tables","title":"Lookup Tables","description":"Fig supports the concept of lookup tables. This is where a set of setting values supplied by a client can be translated into more user friendly values.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/memory-leak-detection":{"id":"features/memory-leak-detection","title":"Memory Leak Detection","description":"Fig has built in memory leak detection. Clients with suspected memory leaks will be shown in the insights page and web hooks can be sent once a possible leak is detected.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/offline-settings":{"id":"features/offline-settings","title":"Offline Settings","description":"By default, clients using the Fig.Client nuget package will support offline settings. This is a fallback mechanism for when the Fig.API is offline. If the client application starts and it is unable to contact the API, it will attempt to load the last values that it got from the API and run with those. It will continue to attempt to contact the API and will update the settings once successfully reconnected.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/advanced-settings":{"id":"features/settings-management/advanced-settings","title":"Advanced Settings","description":"An advanced setting is one that has a reasonable default value that would not need to be changed in a normal deployment. As a result, Fig will hide this setting by default to allow those configuring the application to focus on the settings that do need to be changed. An example might be a timeout value. In most cases, the developer will have chosen a reasonable default but the setting is still included incase it needs to be changed for debugging for when the application is deployed in a specific environment.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/category":{"id":"features/settings-management/category","title":"Category","description":"It is possible to display an association between different settings using the category feature. When a setting is assigned a category, it is assigned a category name and a color which will visually indicate that it is related to other settings with the same color and category name.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/configuration-section":{"id":"features/settings-management/configuration-section","title":"Configuration Section","description":"Fig is a configuration provider which means it sets values when are then made available for consumption within the application. When configuring settings for an application, it makes sense for all configuration items to reside within one class (or at least be referenced from that class). However, there are some use cases where you would like Fig to set values for different configuration sections.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/data-grids":{"id":"features/settings-management/data-grids","title":"Data Grids","description":"Fig supports data grids for displaying complex settings.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/default-values":{"id":"features/settings-management/default-values","title":"Default Values","description":"Fig allows clients to specify a default value for each setting. Default values are specified in the normal way for modern dotnet applications.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/dependent-settings":{"id":"features/settings-management/dependent-settings","title":"Dependent Settings","description":"Sometimes there are settings that enable other settings. For example an application might be able to work both with and without authentication. If authentication is selected then a username and password must be supplied. In this case, we can add an attribute to the authentication switch to hide the irrelevant settings when disabled.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/display-scripts":{"id":"features/settings-management/display-scripts","title":"display-scripts","description":"---","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/groups":{"id":"features/settings-management/groups","title":"Groups","description":"Fig has the capability to group settings from multiple setting clients so they can be edited in one place. This is useful when multiple applications require the same configuration such as a database connection string. With the groups feature this can be set once and applied to all requesting clients simultaneously.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/live-update":{"id":"features/settings-management/live-update","title":"Live Update","description":"Fig supports live setting update by default. This means that when a setting value is updated within the Fig web client and saved, any connected clients will be informed of this change on their next poll interval and then request the updated values and apply them. This can be tracked under connected clients within the web client.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/multiline":{"id":"features/settings-management/multiline","title":"Multi-Line Strings","description":"Multi-line string settings are supported in Fig by adding an attribute to the string setting.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/nested-settings":{"id":"features/settings-management/nested-settings","title":"Nested Settings","description":"This feature was introduced in Fig v0.11.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/ordering":{"id":"features/settings-management/ordering","title":"Ordering","description":"Fig orders settings in the web application in the same order they appear within the settings class.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/secret-settings":{"id":"features/settings-management/secret-settings","title":"Secret Settings","description":"Fig supports protecting the values of some settings. Secret settings are treated as passwords within the web client and are not shown to the configuring user.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/setting-constants":{"id":"features/settings-management/setting-constants","title":"Setting Constants","description":"Fig supports substituting live values with pre-defined constants in string settings so they are available to the using services.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/setting-descriptions":{"id":"features/settings-management/setting-descriptions","title":"Setting Descriptions","description":"Descriptions should be supplied with each setting to explain what the setting does and any potential implications of changing it. Descriptions are provided within the [Setting] attribute.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/supported-types":{"id":"features/settings-management/supported-types","title":"Supported Types","description":"Fig supports most c# property types out of the box with customized editors for each type. More complex types are supported using data grids or JSON.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/valid-values":{"id":"features/settings-management/valid-values","title":"Valid Values (Dropdowns)","description":"In many cases, settings may have a limited set of valid values. In these scenarios, it will assist those configuring the application to provide a dropdown list of valid values to choose from. One example might be the selection of log levels or setting an enum value.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/validation":{"id":"features/settings-management/validation","title":"Validation","description":"String, integer or long type settings can have custom regular expression that will be used to validate the setting. If a value is entered that does not match the regex then a custom message will be shown to the person configuring the setting and saving will not be allowed.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/value-history":{"id":"features/settings-management/value-history","title":"Value History","description":"Every value change that occurs in Fig is recorded in the database and is available from within the setting card.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/verification":{"id":"features/settings-management/verification","title":"Verification","description":"Verification attrbutes can be added to classes to enable verification from within the Web Client.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-table":{"id":"features/settings-table","title":"Settings Table","description":"All settings can be reviewed in table format which includes when the settings where last.

All columns can be filtered or sorted as required.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/user-management":{"id":"features/user-management","title":"User Management","description":"Administrators in the Fig web client have the ability to manage users. They are able to create and delete users (or other administrators) as well as set and reset passwords.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/verifications":{"id":"features/verifications","title":"Verifications","description":"Fig includes a framework for verifying setting values from within the UI. The setting verifications occur within the Fig API.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/web-hooks":{"id":"features/web-hooks","title":"Web Hooks","description":"Fig has a web hook integration point which allows third party integrations to be called by Fig in response to certain events occurring. This allows events from Fig to be available more widely for example sent to someone via email or posted to a Slack or Teams channel.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/api-secret-migration":{"id":"guides/api-secret-migration","title":"API Secret Migration","description":"The API Secret is used to sign and verify login tokens as well as to encrypt data within the database.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/client-secret-migration":{"id":"guides/client-secret-migration","title":"Client Secret Migration","description":"The client secret is used to safeguard the setting values for any specific setting client. This guide explains how the secret can be changed.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/configuring-tls":{"id":"guides/configuring-tls","title":"Configuring TLS","description":"Fig is able to run both its api and web instances with TLS enabled, provided the required environment variables and pem encoded certificate files are made available. This is aimed at use within docker containers, but equivalent configuration on host environments such as windows will also work for the api, but not the web instance.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/encrypting-secrets-dpapi":{"id":"guides/encrypting-secrets-dpapi","title":"Encrypting Client Secrets","description":"When installed on Windows, Fig requires client secrets to be encrypted in DPAPI.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/integration-testing":{"id":"guides/integration-testing","title":"Integration Testing ASP.NET Core Apps","description":"If your application uses Fig for configuration then you have some options when it comes to integration testing. The first option is to use Fig for configuration as part of your integration test. However, this means you are essentially integration testing the Fig application too and is probably not desirable in most cases. The other option involves disabling fig and injecting in a different configuration provider for the tests. Fig comes packaged with a convenient reloadable configuration provider which makes updating configuraiton in integration tests very easy.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integration-points/lookup-table-integration":{"id":"integration-points/lookup-table-integration","title":"Lookup Table Integrations","description":"In addition to being able to create, update and delete lookup tables via the Fig web application, it is also possible to write an integration that performs the same functions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integration-points/web-hook-integration":{"id":"integration-points/web-hook-integration","title":"Web Hook Integrations","description":"Fig has an integration point which allows notifications to be sent as a result of certain events occurring within the system.

This provides a lot of flexibility but can also be confusing for those configuring the application. Fig is also a configuration provider and as such, can work along side other configuration sources. However, fig is more than just a configuration provider. It is a complete solution for managing settings across multiple micro-services. This is because when an application starts up, it registers its configuration with Fig meaning those settings are now viewable and editable from within the Fig web application.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"overview/why-fig":{"id":"overview/why-fig","title":"Why Fig?","description":"If you have ever created a service or other application, you probably found at some stage you needed to add some configurable components.
