Fig has an integration to Azure Key Vault and if enabled, all values marked as secret attribute will be stored there rather than the fig database.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/change-message":{"id":"features/change-message","title":"Change Message","description":"When you save settings changes, you will be prompted to enter a change message.

This feature is particularly useful for monitoring, debugging, and implementing health checks in your applications.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/offline-settings":{"id":"features/offline-settings","title":"Offline Settings","description":"By default, clients using the Fig.Client nuget package will support offline settings. This is a fallback mechanism for when the Fig.API is offline.

It will continue to attempt to contact the API and will update the settings once successfully reconnected.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/scheduling":{"id":"features/scheduling","title":"Scheduling","description":"The Scheduling feature in Fig allows users to defer the application of setting changes or schedule the automatic reverting of settings changes to a later time.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/advanced-settings":{"id":"features/settings-management/advanced-settings","title":"Advanced Settings","description":"An advanced setting is one that has a reasonable default value that would not need to be changed in a normal deployment. As a result, Fig will hide this setting by default to allow those configuring the application to focus on the settings that do need to be changed. An example might be a timeout value. In most cases, the developer will have chosen a reasonable default but the setting is still included incase it needs to be changed for debugging for when the application is deployed in a specific environment.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/category":{"id":"features/settings-management/category","title":"Category","description":"It is possible to display an association between different settings using the category feature.

This is useful when multiple applications require the same configuration such as a database connection string. With the groups feature this can be set once and applied to all requesting clients simultaneously.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"features/settings-management/live-update":{"id":"features/settings-management/live-update","title":"Live Update","description":"Fig supports live setting update by default.

However, this means you are essentially integration testing the Fig application too and is probably not desirable in most cases. The other option involves disabling fig and injecting in a different configuration provider for the tests. Fig comes packaged with a convenient reloadable configuration provider which makes updating configuration in integration tests very easy.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/version1-version2-migration-guide":{"id":"guides/version1-version2-migration-guide","title":"Fig Version 1.x to 2.x Migration Guide","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integration-points/lookup-table-integration":{"id":"integration-points/lookup-table-integration","title":"Lookup Table Integrations","description":"In addition to being able to create, update and delete lookup tables via the Fig web application, it is also possible to write an integration that performs the same functions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integration-points/web-hook-integration":{"id":"integration-points/web-hook-integration","title":"Web Hook Integrations","description":"Fig has an integration point which allows notifications to be sent as a result of certain events occurring within the system.

This provides a lot of flexibility but can also be confusing for those configuring the application. Fig is also a configuration provider and as such, can work along side other configuration sources. However, fig is more than just a configuration provider. It is a complete solution for managing settings across multiple micro-services. This is because when an application starts up, it registers its configuration with Fig meaning those settings are now viewable and editable from within the Fig web application.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"overview/why-fig":{"id":"overview/why-fig","title":"Why Fig?","description":"If you have ever created a service or other application, you probably found at some stage you needed to add some configurable components.
